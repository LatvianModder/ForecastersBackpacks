Forecaster's Backpacks
======================

Forecaster's Backpacks is an addon for Forestry I made for Forecaster. It adds a couple of new backpack types.

It is entirely made for fun, and nothing else.

### New backpacks? Tell me more!

Right now the mod adds the following backpacks (both standard and woven versions), more may come in the future.

  - Pneumatic Engineer's Backpack: The main reason I made this mod. Holds all your PneumaticCraft stuff.
  - Computer Engineer's Backpack: Holds stuff from ComputerCraft, OpenComputers and all their addons. If you find an addon which is not supported, tell me.
  - Flamingo Backpack: Holds anything added by the Flamingo mod.
  - Scholar's Backpack: Holds anything added by BiblioCraft as well as some additional items like Paper, Maps and books.
  - Industrialist's Backpack: Holds anything added by IndustrialCraft 2 as well as anything that fits into an IC2 Toolbox.
  - Warrior's Backpack: Holds Swords, Bows, Arrows and anything added by Balkon's Weapon Mod or QuiverBow.
  - Plumber's Backpack: Holds your BuildCraft Pipes and Wrenches (anything from BuildCraft Transport).
